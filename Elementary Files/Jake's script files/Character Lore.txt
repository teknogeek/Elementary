Description: This huge building has been standing for nearly 100 years, it is a beautiful building that still plays host to a wide variety of activities.
Wonderful that no matter what happens in life the buildings have a longer life expectancy than us.
Hopefully if I'm here and there is another attack I will be safe.

Weight: 73kg
Sex: Male
Age: 23
Hair colour: Brown

Description: I've never been a really "cool" person, I've always been into playing games and writing programs on my computer.
I suppose you could call me a nerd or whatever, but I don't care what many people think, I'm with someone I think I love and I enjoy my life.
No matter how many times I've killed a monster in a game on my computer, during the attacks six years ago I wasn't prepared for anything like that, but then again I don't think anyone was.
I just hope no matter what happens at any time that Sarah will be safe.

Description: An angry old Scot who does nothing in his spare time other than drinking cheap vodka. 
He has what he calls a "passion" for English literature, everyone knows that he is just a sad old man with nothing to do in life anymore.
Every day he goes home in his old station wagon to his lonely shack on the hill, sometimes I wonder what could be in there. Is he really some kind of superhero or something?

#Biology Teacher#

Weight: 70kg
Sex: Female
Age: 39
Hair colour: Brown

Description: A creepy old woman who looks as old as the building itself. No one seems to know anything about her, as if she has no life other than working.
I can see the gaping hole that sadness has created in her eyes, she must be lonely, maybe she has had family issues in the past. She proves to know a lot about Humans and the way we think and behave.
My bets were always on her to find out what those things were. Will we ever know?

Description: Their origin is unknown, we don't know why they are here, all we know is that they want nothing but destruction. They first attacked us 10 years ago. 
The human race tried to fight back, but they were too powerful, one billion people died, since their first attack we started fortifying the Earth and it's atmosphere. 
Their last attack was six years ago. They are back, we sounded the alarms, but who knows if we can hold out this time. We thought we had extinct them during their last attack.
Their only known weakness is delivery of huge damage very quickly, their skin seems to repair itself if you don't kill it quickly enough.
