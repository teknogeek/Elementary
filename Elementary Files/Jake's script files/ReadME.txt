How to edit MY files:
DO NOT EDIT MY FUCKING FILES. If you want something changed ask me and I will reply as soon as I can. If you ignore this I will find you. And I will kill you.




Useful Note:
As this story continues and choices etc are added into the game, the file structure may become hard to follow, please continue to check this ReadME.txt file for extended information about my file structure.
If you have any questions, please ask me before you implement something wrongly.




TIFFANY: You should ignore these first 18 lines. All you need to know is below this sentence.




Character Lore Structure:
The character lore is a first person account of characters from Lorenzo's point of view. The descriptions of each character will update as the game progresses.
In the chapter 1 folder there will  be the original character set with their info before the attacks. If there is another text document of that character in a chapter after chapter 1 etc, it is an updated version
that has to be added to the characters tab in the pause menu.



Diaries:
Diaries can be collected throughout the game and reveal more about the characters from their point of view. They can be placed wherever the coders please, the lab notes must stay within classrooms
for them to make the most sense. Try to space the diaries throughout the game to avoid mass reading all at once.




How the files are structured:

Any sentences marked with a "*" are actions of the game itself.

Anything marked with a "#" is showing the setting for the particular scene.

Any time that there is something written in brackets after a name before the colon is how a piece of speech is meant to be said.

Anything marked with only brackets () shows gameplay changes.

Square brackets [] mark onscreen splash screens that explain features and how they work.

Curly brackets {} mark when text will be shown on the top of the screen.

Three "@" symbols will be used to mark the start and end of cinematics.

Two stars "**" will be used to tell the coders and sound artifactor what to add in a particular scene.
