Description: Their origin is unknown, we don't know why they are here, all we know is that they want nothing but destruction. They first attacked us 10 years ago. 
The human race tried to fight back, but they were too powerful, one billion people died, since their first attack we started fortifying the Earth and it's atmosphere. 
Their last attack was six years ago. They are back, we sounded the alarms, but who knows if we can hold out this time. We thought we had extinct them during their last attack.
Their only known weakness is delivery of huge damage very quickly, their skin seems to repair itself if you don't kill it quickly enough.
