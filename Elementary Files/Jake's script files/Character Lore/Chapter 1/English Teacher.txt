Description: An angry old Scot who does nothing in his spare time other than drinking cheap vodka. 
He has what he calls a "passion" for English literature, everyone knows that he is just a sad old man with nothing to do in life anymore.
Every day he goes home in his old station wagon to his lonely shack on the hill, sometimes I wonder what could be in there. Is he really some kind of superhero or something?
