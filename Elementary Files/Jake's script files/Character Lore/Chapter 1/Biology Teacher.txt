Description: A creepy old woman who looks as old as the building itself. No one seems to know anything about her, as if she has no life other than working.
I can see the gaping hole that sadness has created in her eyes, she must be lonely, maybe she has had family issues in the past. She proves to know a lot about Humans and the way we think and behave.
My bets were always on her to find out what those things were. Will we ever know?
