Description: I've never been a really "cool" person, I've always been into playing games and writing programs on my computer.
I suppose you could call me a nerd or whatever, but I don't care what many people think, I'm with someone I think I love and I enjoy my life.
No matter how many times I've killed a monster in a game on my computer, during the attacks six years ago I wasn't prepared for anything like that, but then again I don't think anyone was.
I just hope no matter what happens at any time that Sarah will be safe.
